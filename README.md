# Trends-in-US-Major-Pollutants
In this project I studied a variety of pollutants, namely carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and Sulphur dioxide, between years 2000 and 2016 that significantly contributed to pollution in all fifty states of the United States of America. 
According to the analysis of all the months,I found that New York has the most significant rate of NO2 emissions among all the states, Tennessee has the lowest rate, and the NO2 mean value is lower in the summer, which includes the months from June to September, and the highest in the month of February. 
Additionally, the mean and highest values of the NO2 air quality index are close to twenty-five, which is good because it is within the range of 0 to 50, which is considered good according to the AQI forecast used by government agencies.
We have concentrated more on the five states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, and Texas for the other three pollutants. 
Texas has the lowest CO mean, whereas Arizona has the highest, and among the five states' O3 mean values, Florida has the highest emissions, and California has the lowest. 
The SO2 mean values typically range from 0 to 2. 
Texas has the highest AQI value, which indicates a high pollution rate, while Colorado has the lowest AQI value, which indicates a low pollution rate. 
And, also found it to be surprising that carbon monoxide emission shows a declining tendency over time, with only slight rises in between after the data analysis.
